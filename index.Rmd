This page contains a collection of documents from R group meetings at the University of Montana.  In addition, I have challenged myself to use this site to document solutions and resources for all the widely applicable questions asked of me during the semester.

A primary goal of this site is to encourage best practices and coherent workflows within R.  To that end, much of the material presented here sythesizes other, more pointed, documentation.
