# How2R

Besides being a collection of documents from R group meetings at the University of Montana, I have challenged myself to add documents and resources for all the widely applicable questions asked of me during the semester.

Much of the content here is something like a CliffsNotes version of the actual documentation, which is cited within the documents.
